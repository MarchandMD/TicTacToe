CURRENT GOAL: FINISH THE GAME CLASS

The testing for the `game#initialize` method that sets the current player and other player should be updated to something more recent for RSpec 3.10. But I don't know what it is. 

alright, I have a fragile version of the game completed. 

The next thing I want to do is address the issue about the game allowing for moves to be overwritten. 

Where would I add an `#evaluate_move` method? 

is that something to be done during the game? Is that something to be done when setting the value? Is that a nuance of the `Board`? 

I feel like evaluating the move could be a method for the `Game`, the `Board` or the `Cell`.
