tl; dr - to quickly manage your Ruby project with RBENV, simply add a hidden file to your project's root directory (hidden files start with a period '.'; the root directory is the folder that contains everything else for that project). it should be called `.ruby-version`; use a hyphen, not an underscore. Add the version of the software in the body of the file. literally whatever the current version (or past version) you want to require. like this: 
```
2.7.2
```

now to the rest of my learning....
