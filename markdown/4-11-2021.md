# Monkey Patching

At this point of my coding/learning process, i'm comfortable with the idea of the `Objects` in the Ruby language. Like, I understand that there are `Arrays` and `Strings` and other data types.

I'm also familiar with the idea that instances of these objects have methods.

The academic/student in me wants to learn all the objects and all the methods that exist. It's just a natural extension of the learning process: If I'm learning things on my own and I'm teaching myself, why not teach myself all the different Objects and all the different methods that exist for them?

While that's a noble idea, it seems to be a little futile now. At least in the current iteration of my learning.

I mean, everything in Ruby is an Object. And then there's the idea of inheritance. And there's all these increasing levels of abstraction that would eventually make sense...but it'd be a really long time before that would happen.

What I've found is that it's a little more natural to actually be building programs and then find which Objects and methods I need specifically.

It's the idea of learning by doing. If I'm building a program and I need an object do to a specific thing, i'm more likely to find if there's a method that does the specific thing I'm looking for.

At that point, there's then this experience of building something, needing the programming language to do something, and knowing that there is a method specifically to do that.

Eventually more Objects and more methods will become apparent to me.

However, there is one really neat feature of coding that is the purpose of this article:

#### It's possible to create methods that I can add to the language at the global level (at least for my program)

That's a strange idea. Throughout my entire journey there's always been this idea of some "source" code that just shouldn't be messed with. Whether it's on `sudo` on the command line, or some other configurations within the machine, there's always an aversion to keeping the "source" at an arms length.

Being able to add to the actual language feels like a powerful thing, but i think the point is to not be afraid of it, and see it for what it is: just writing a method for an Object.

### extending the language

So there's something that programmers call "monkey patching". I don't really know where it came from, but i think the point is, Monkey-patching is just like writing code, and then adding it to the main code without it actually bieng an official update or change. Just something added for the time being to make it work.

so I'm going to extend the `Array` class.

IN my project, just create a file called `core_extensions.rb`.

Now, since I'm extending the `Array` class, I need to start writing code that allows me to update it.

`Array` is just a class. I've already written classes in my project. So I'm just doing:

```ruby
class Array
end
```

and then I'm adding additional methods within that class:

```ruby
class Array
  # my methods will go in here
end
```

The reasoning for wanting to "monkey patch" the Ruby Language is a little confusing to me. I'm not really sure "when" it would be the right thing to do.

But as I reflect a little more about it and use my brain, I tell myself the following:

> If I can monkey patch the Ruby language for my program, why wouldn't I try to put everything into the Ruby langauge? Like, why wouldn't I put all my objects into Ruby?

And I guess there's a couple of answers to that.

1. that's sort of already being done, by creating new objects
2. that'd be sort of a dumb thing to do, because some new object I name and create wouldn't necessarily be the same as someone elses

I mean, one of the main idea of OOP is Encapsulation. That is, something like an Array is finite. But it can be extended. More on this later, maybe.

For now, I think it's best to think that Monkey patching may work when I need or want to do something to an existing Ruby Object, like an Array.

But I think being able to identify when I can Monkey Patch something will come in time.

So for now, here's what the tutorial is doing:

```ruby
class Array
  def all_empty?
    self.all? { |element| element.to_s.empty? }
  end
end
```

So this `#all_empty?` method is a new predicate method that combines `Enumerable#all?` and `Array#empty?`. 

Obviously this will somehow be called on each element of the `Board` since the game board is an array of arrays. So this will probably be used in combination with `Array#each?`. 

## now write a test
If I write code, I should test it too. 

Eventually the goal is to write tests first and then write the code. For now though, time to practice writing in `RSpec`. 

```ruby
#../spec/core_extensions_spec.rb (this is the location of the file)

require_relative 'spec_helper'

RSpec.describe Array do
  context "#all_empty?" do
    it "returns true if all elements of the Array are empty" do
      expect(["","",""].all_empty?).to be true
    end
  end
end
```

Shouldn't be any surprises here. 

So, reflecting on this `#all_empty?` method, why is it being built? 

1. it'll help determine if the game is over. If a row is empty, then it's not a draw...so that's one piece of logic

Ok, moving on. 

the next extensions to the `Array` class is going to be: `#all_same?`. Obviously this would be a good way to tell if a single row has all the same values. Like all "x"s or all "o"s. 

```ruby
def all_same?
  self.all? { |element| element == self[0] }
end
```

If this doesn't make sense then you should probably look at what: 

* `self` 
* `Enumerable#all?`

That should clear it up for you. 

Now that some code has been written, I want to make sure it does what I think it'll do, so write a test!
