# The Player class

```ruby
module Tictactoe
  class Player
    attr_reader :color, :name
    def initialize(input)
      @color = input.fetch(:color)
      @name = input.fetch(:name)
    end
  end
end
```
so there is going to be some required input for the `Player` class when it's initialized, and it's going to be a `Hash` object. So, after that, it's a matter of assigning values to the instance variables of `@color` and `@name`. 

Now it's time to bring this class into the overall program itself. The way I do this is by adding this file to the `lib/tictactoe.rb` file...which is kind of like a manifest file. Again, do this with `require` or `require_relative`. 

```ruby
#lib/tictactoe.rb

...
require_relative 'tictactoe/player'
```

Ok, now that that's done, I know that the `Player` class is now being "seen" by Ruby if I were to run the program. 

Now it's time to set up the testing for the `Player` class. 

First thing I'll do is set up the `player_spec.rb` file in the right directory....

Next thing I'll do is pull in the `spec_helper.rb` file, since it's required on all tests.

Ok. I think I should be good to start writing/running tests for the `Player` class. 

Alright, so here where things go a little strange. I got a big warning in rspec, essentially correcting me, asking me to be more specific in my test. But I don't really know how to be more specific, so I'll look to documentation for direction. 

Alright, so that was one of my first real foray's back into the RSpec documentation, and it went pretty smoothly. But that's mostly because I've seen it before and I know what I was looking for. There's still a lot there that I don't know, but at least I know there's some documentation there, and sort of how to read it. 

I'm actually a little nervous about making any change to the open source project. But why should I be? 

Just make a small change and then submit a pull request. And then make more changes, maybe. Just a little at a time. I don't really want to do a complete overhaul of the site. But I do want to update some things. Like it'd be dope to do that. like to just get a feel for it. That way I'm not just correcting it. 

But I'm not sure if I should completely correct it, or if I should do something else. Like, if I should do something like....provide direction. Instead of just correcting it. But I mean, making a suggestion for making a serious change would probably be cause for pause by the original author. I mean, he can decide ultimately to reject my contribution. That's totally his perogative. 

I'm sort of torn. I mean, I know there's a lot to do in the thing. I don't know why i think I can only do one thing. And that's the point. I've already gotten pretty fucking far with this tutorial, and I said I would try to do a second one as well. So i can sort of re-inforce the idea, and work on multiple things. I'm not really sure. I don't really know what I want to do. 

I mean, I know that I definitely want to keep going. But maybe I should try to do something else at the same time. 

# Blackjack
What's the most basic unit/object of a Blackjack game? 
The card. 

So that's the first class.
