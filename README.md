# Tictactoe

Welcome to this repository! It's a gem I built, by following along to [this tutorial](https://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2013/10/25/creating-a-tic-tac-toe-game-with-ruby/) but it hasn't been deployed on Rubygems or anything. 

To experiment with the code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

I mean, you could pull it to your local machine...

<!-- Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tictactoe'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tictactoe -->

## Usage

Play tic tac toe! If you're learning, contact me! I'm learning too!

## Development

this is such a small project I can imagine anyone would want to contribute to it. 

<!-- After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org). -->
